# Atom Dark Vibrant Syntax theme

I have always liked the default Atom Dark syntax color scheme, but I felt that the colors themselves
were too dull and muted (particularly the blues and purple, which seemed pastel-like). This theme is
my attempt to fix that. it is a fork of atom-dark-syntax, but with more vibrant colors.
